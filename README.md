# HODL
An app to track your personal Crypto portfolio profits, losses, and fees.

## Summary
Have you ever bought some crypto and had to pull out a calculator to see how much you paid in fees, see how much profit/loss your currently at or try to figure out the total amount of money you have invested? Yeah I find that kind of annoying so I decided to make an app for that.
HODL will have some similarities to coinmarketcap.com, so a user can view/search a large list of crypto currencies, then select a currency to view more details about, and favorite, or add a transaction with info like the date, dollar amount, currency amount, price of currency at the time, and fee paid. 


## Technology

- Next.js, a React.js framework
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI


## The Game Plan
As a primarily front end developer this app will start out with no logins or back end, getting data about coins from 3rd party sources, and storing any of your transactions locally. My intention is to eventually build out a back end, DB, and login so anyone can use this to track their crypto, and eventually connect with other apps like CoinBase to automatically update transactions for you.

### MVP
#### Main page
- Should show total money invested including fees, total fees paid, total current profit/loss.
- should display a list of the top coins, with the option to search, go to next page, or select a coin to view more details.
- should be able to view only favorited/owned coins

#### Coin detail page
- For the selected coin should show total money invested including fees, total fees paid, total current profit/loss.
- should be able to add a transaction. Could be buying, selling, or fee for transfering coin to another wallet.
- The ability to include a trade of one coin to another with fees may not be part of MVP

#### Misc
- set up for light/dark mode
- save transactions and favorites in local storage or json file
