# HODL
An app to track your personal Crypto portfolio profits, losses, and fees.

## Summary
Have you ever bought some crypto and had to pull out a calculator to see how much you paid in fees, see how much profit/loss your currently at or try to figure out the total amount of money you have invested? Yeah I find that kind of annoying so I decided to make an app for that.
HODL will have some similarities to coinmarketcap.com, so a user can view/search a large list of crypto currencies, then select a currency to view more details about, and favorite, or add a transaction with info like the date, dollar amount, currency amount, price of currency at the time, and fee paid. 


## Technology

- Next.js, a React.js framework
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI


## The Game Plan
As a primarily front end developer this app will start out with no logins or back end, getting data about coins from 3rd party sources, and storing any of your transactions locally. My intention is to eventually build out a back end, DB, and login so anyone can use this to track their crypto, and eventually connect with other apps like CoinBase to automatically update transactions for you.
